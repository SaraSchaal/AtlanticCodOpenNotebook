Quantification on Qubit DNA Broad Range kit 

8 samples + 2 Standards = 10 qubit vials

10.1 samples (10% error) 

199*10.1 = 2009.9 uL buffer

1*10.1     = 10.1 uL of reagent 

                = 2020 uL total



Fragment DNA on Covaris ME220 sonicator (CAT #) to a size of 150 bp 

Used 8 microTUBE-50 AFA Fiber H Slit Strip V2 (PN 520240) which takes 55 uL sample

I want enough fragmented DNA to do 4 library preps 2000 ng of DNA some samples could only do 1000 ng.
